# Twitter_sentiment_analysis


-- I used Twitter Sentiment Dataset from Kaggle
-- Used NLTK tools like PorterStemmer to do stemming of similar words and stopwords to remove english stopwords.
-- now to calculate sentiment score used TfidVectorizer to calculate the score from the content 
-- used basic Logistical Regression for model training and testing
